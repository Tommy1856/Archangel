# Archangel

Archangel is a Person Project developed with Unreal Engine 4.27

The Aim of this proejct was to explore what could be created with Free Epic Games Marketplace Assets 
and to create it within a set time frame of 1 Week.

The scope was to remain as simple as possible. I decied to a "Boss Battle" style melee combat mission, the type you would find in a classic RPG.
The Player must defeat a Griffin that is defending the gateway in order to win the level. They have a sheild with which they can block attacks and a sword to deal them. If the Griffin is defeated, the Player wins. If the Player dies, they lose.
