# Archangel

Archangel is a Person Project developed with Unreal Engine 4.27

The Aim of this proejct was to explore what could be created with Free Epic Games Marketplace Assets 
and to create it within a set time frame of 1 Week.

The scope was to remain as simple as possible. I decied to create a "Boss Battle" style arena set in an old medieval ruin with a Royal Griffin that has to defeat to complete the level
